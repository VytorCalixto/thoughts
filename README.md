# Thoughts

Test app with Ionic, Firebase, Angular.JS and Cordova.
***
Thoughts is **_the_ new** way of sharing your thoughts in **_freaking_ real time**. From your head to your friends in *FREAKING REAL TIME*.

Don't limit your thoughts to yourself, share it. Not only people will see how disturbed you are, but you will be able to read others thoughts! You'll be like an *X-man*, reading minds and stuff.

## Why use Thoughts?

* Share to the world your deep thoughts and great ideas. People will start knowing you better.
* Fill your head with others people's thoughts if you don't have anything good to think about.
* You will be like Professor Xavier, but still be able to walk.
* You will be able to login with other social networks accounts and share to them. Don't stop the world from reading what you think.
* People think **all** the time. Thoughts are an unlimited resource. Why not share?
* Great way of reminding things you said/thought a long time ago and totally forgotted. Like your keys. And other stuff.
* You can use it like your digital agenda and let EVERYBODY know what you will do and where you will be.
* Great way to know if you have chances with your crush (and it's way better than asking if you have chances).

## F.A.Q.

1. Is this for real?
  * No. I'm just testing stuff.
2. With the app, will I be able to read minds?
  * Only if the other person is registered in Thoughts!
3. Why the thing with X-man?
  * I don't know. Days of a future past was a good movie.
